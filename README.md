# Description

Installs a bash profile from http://github.com/fnichol/bashrc.

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on 0.10.2 and 0.10.4 but newer and older version should work just fine.
File an [issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes run on these platforms without error:

* ubuntu
* debian
* mac_os_x

## Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:

* [git][git_cb] (Opscode)

# Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

## Using Librarian

The [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'user',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-bashrc.git', :ref => 'v0.2.2'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

## Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-bashrc/v0.2.2

## As a Git Submodule

A common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-bashrc.git cookbooks/user
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-bashrc/tarball/v0.2.2 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-bashrc-* bashrc

## From the Opscode Community Platform

This cookbook is not currently available on the site due to its limited use
to the community at large.

# Usage

## bashrc Installed System-Wide

If you want to install *bashrc* across the entire system, then include
`recipe[bashrc::system]` in your run\_list.

## bashrc Installed For A Specific User

If you want to install *bashrc* only for a specific user, then include
`recipe[bashrc::user]` in your run\_list and add a hash to the
`user_installs` attribute list. For example:

    node['bashrc']['user_installs'] = [
      { 'user'    => 'smithers',
        'update'  => true
      }
    ]

See below for more details.

# Recipes

## default

Installs the common package pre-requisites used by the *system* and *user*
recipes.

There is no reason to include this recipe.

## system

Installs the bashrc profile system-wide (that is, into `/etc/bash`). This
recipe includes *default*.

Use this recipe by itself if you want the bashrc profile available across all
users on the system.

## user

Installs the bashrc profile for a list of users (selected from the
`node['bashrc']['user_installs']` hash). This recipe includes *default*.

Use this recipe by itself if you want the bashrc profile available only
to specific users or if the user running Chef does not have root privileges.

# Attributes

## update

Whether or not to update *bashrc* system-wide on every Chef execution.

The default is `false`.

## user\_update

Whether or not to update *bashrc* for user installs by default on every
Chef execution. Each user can override this value by setting an `update`
attribute in their user hash.

## installer\_url

The URL containing the system-wide installer script.

The default is
`https://raw.github.com/fnichol/bashrc/master/contrib/install-system-wide`.

## user\_installer\_url

The URL containing the per-user installer script.

The default is
`https://raw.github.com/fnichol/bashrc/master/contrib/install-local`.
